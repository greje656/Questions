Hi Jorge,

First of all, I'm a huge fan! I wanted to get that out of the way :P Huge huge fan of all the filtering work you've done in the last few years (aa, ssss, dof/motion blur)

I've recently been trying to implement the Depth of Field solution you presented at Siggraph (NEXT GENERATION POST PROCESSING IN CALL OF DUTY: ADVANCED WARFARE, SIGGRAPH 2014) and was wondering if you'd be ok with answering a few questions. Will try to keep them simple (kind of yes or no questions)

Question 1)
Is this really the raw results of what the foreground layer should look like? Or is this some kind of visualization mode of the foreground weights combined with the foreground result?

The results I seem to get for the foreground layer is more like:
